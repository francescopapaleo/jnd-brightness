### Research Question And Relevance

What is the just noticeable difference (JND) for the brightness of a sound? The spectral centroid is directly connected to the subjective perception of brightness. The aim of this research is to find whatâ€™s the smallest variation in the spectral centroid of the spectrum of a sound sample, that creates noticeable variations in brightness. 

It is important to notice that within the framework of current research, we use the notions of brightness and spectral centroid interchangeably. Although there were proposed many different definitions of brightness, it is still an open and quite complex question how such a purely subjective concept as brightness can be measured and quantified. Therefore, we decided to use the most popular definition of brightness as a spectral centroid, since we believe it will be adequate for the purposes of measuring the JND.

We decided to focus on sounds with broad spectral information, specifically we use pink noise samples with limited bandwidth. Thus, we will be able to study brightness perception of a sound independently of its timbre. Two groups of people will be tested: with and without musical knowledge. As a consequence, apart from determining the JNDs for brightness, we will see if the characteristics of the sound and the type of listeners influence the JND. 

This study could be relevant to determine the subjectivity of brightness perception, the influence of musical background into listening skills and the importance of adaptive listening in the perception of sound characteristics. In addition, the discovered information could be useful to develop some audio tools like for example a brightness plug-in. This plug-in could consist of a scroll bar of steps, to modify brightness. Each step would be determined by the JND we propose.

Research Question condensed : How much of a shift in the spectral centroid must occur before a difference in perceived brightness can be observed ?
